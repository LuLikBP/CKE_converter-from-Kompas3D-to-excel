 **Hi!**
 
This utility will allow you to get the specification from the KOMPAS-3D assembly file and translate it into the excel table. You can also select the necessary parameters for the specification and exclude unnecessary from it.
 
The ```KOMPASS version 18 and older``` is required for the application to work, and the application also does not work with tables of outdated format (```.xlsx```).
 
## How to use it?
 
* Download the application in the release (.exe file)
* Specify the path to the KOMPAS-3d assembly file
* Specify the path in the excel table where you want to move the specification
* Click on the ```"Conversion"``` button, after that the excel file that you specified will automatically open and be filled with the data that was selected
